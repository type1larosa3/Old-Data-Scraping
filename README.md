This an old data science project I did a while back.

The code is kinda ugly but it was used to track challenge results and figure out which cards of interest would be the most likely to be banned.

The code is old but the website looks the same at the new url. Maybe it still works idk. https://www.mtgo.com/decklist/modern-challenge-32-2024-12-1712714134 mig
